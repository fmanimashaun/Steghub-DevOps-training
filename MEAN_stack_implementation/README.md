# Implementing MEAN Stack on AWS EC2 with Self-Hosted MongoDB: My Learning Journey

This README documents my personal experience setting up a MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) stack application on an AWS EC2 instance for production, using a self-hosted MongoDB database. I’ll share insights, challenges, and lessons learned throughout the process.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this journey, I ensured I had:
- An AWS EC2 instance running Ubuntu
- Basic knowledge of Linux commands
- A MEAN stack application ready for deployment

> **Personal Note:** Setting up the EC2 instance was straightforward, but I recommend thoroughly understanding AWS security groups and network settings before proceeding. See my [previous video](https://youtu.be/5K0mHssuN-I) on how to set it up.

> Ensure that ports 5000 and 27017 are open in the security group.

>NB: if you have issues connecting to your ssh and you have checked that all configurations, security group and all are correct by your ssh command refused to work, kindly run the command below:

```bash
sudo xattr -c <key-pair.pem> // make sure you are inside the folder that has the kep-pair.pem
sudo chmod 400 <key-pair.pem>
```

## Installing MongoDB

Installing MongoDB was more involved than I initially thought. Here's what I did:

1. Imported the public key for the MongoDB package:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-7.0.asc | \
       sudo gpg -o /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-7.0.gpg --dearmor
    ```

2. Created a MongoDB source list file:

    ```bash
    echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-7.0.gpg ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu jammy/mongodb-org/7.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-7.0.list
    ```

3. Updated the package list and installed MongoDB:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
    ```

4. Started MongoDB and enabled it to start on boot:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start mongod
    sudo systemctl enable mongod
    ```

5. Verified the installation:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status mongod
    ```

> **Personal Note:** The installation process was smooth, but I found the [official MongoDB documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/#std-label-install-mdb-community-ubuntu) incredibly helpful. I'd recommend keeping it open in a separate tab for reference.

## Configuring MongoDB

Configuring MongoDB for production use was crucial. Here’s what I learned:

1. **Configuring for remote access (optional):**

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/mongod.conf
    ```

    Changed the `bindIp` setting:

    ```yaml
    net:
      bindIp: 0.0.0.0
    ```

> **Insight:** While this allows remote connections, it’s essential to understand the security implications. In a real production environment, I would limit this to specific IP addresses. For my case, I kept the default configuration because there was no intention to communicate with MongoDB remotely.

2. **Secure the the Mongodb:**
    Start MongoDB without authentication enabled:
    ```bash
    mongosh
    ```
    Connect to MongoDB and create the admin user:
   ```mongosh
    use admin
    ```
    ```mongosh
    use admin

    db.createUser(
        {
            user: "root",
            pwd: "Password.1",
            roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" }, "readWriteAnyDatabase" ]
        }
    )

    exit
    ```
    Now, edit the MongoDB configuration file (usually /etc/mongod.conf on Linux systems) to enable authentication:
      ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/mongod.conf
    ```

    Changed the `security` setting:
    ```yaml
    security:
        authorization: enabled
    ```
    > **Insight:** Enabling authentication is crucial for security. Without it, anyone could potentially access your database.

    Restart the MongoDB service to apply the changes.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart mongod
    ```

3. **Setting up a MongoDB user:**

    ```bash
     mongosh --authenticationDatabase "admin" -u "root" -p
    ```

    ```mongosh
    use sample_book_register_app
    db.createUser({
      user: "bookRegisterUser",
      pwd: "Password.1",
      roles: [{ role: "readWrite", db: "sample_book_register_app" }]
    })
    ```

> **Personal Note:** Creating a specific user for the application, rather than using the root user, is a best practice I’m glad I followed. You can set your own password; `Password.1` is used here for demonstration purposes.

The resulting connection string:

```
mongodb://bookRegisterUser:Password.1@localhost:27017/sample_book_register_app?authSource=sample_book_register_app
```

## Installing Node.js

Installing Node.js was straightforward:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Verified the installation:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Setting Up PM2 Process Manager

PM2 was new to me, but I quickly realized its importance for production:

```bash
sudo npm install pm2 -g
```

> **Insight:** PM2’s ability to keep the application running after system reboots is invaluable for maintaining uptime.

## Installing and Configuring Nginx

Setting up Nginx as a reverse proxy was an enlightening experience:

1. Installed Nginx:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nginx -y
    ```

2. Created a custom Nginx configuration:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/sample_book_register_app
    ```

Configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'Upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

> **Personal Note:** Understanding how Nginx works as a reverse proxy was a major learning point. It’s not just about routing traffic but also potential performance improvements and additional security.

3. Activated the new configuration and deactivated the default:

    ```bash
    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/sample_book_register_app /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    sudo nginx -t
    sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```

> **Insight:** The symlink approach for managing Nginx configurations is elegant and makes it easy to enable or disable sites.

## Deploying the MEAN Application

Finally, the moment of truth—deploying the application:

1. Install the Angular-cli:

    ```bash
    sudo npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```

2. Clone the MEAN Stack project repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fmanimashaun/sample-book-register-app.git
    ```

3. Set up the frontend:

    ```bash
    cd sample-book-register-app/client
    sudo npm i && sudo npm run build
    ```

> **Personal Note:** Deploying a MEAN app to production without external services was quite interesting.

4. Set up the backend:

    ```bash
    cd ../backend
    sudo npm i
    ```

5. Created the `.env` file inside the backend folder:

    ```bash
    sudo nano .env
    ```

Content:

```
PORT=5000
DB=mongodb://bookRegisterUser:Password.1@localhost:27017/sample_book_register_app?authSource=sample_book_register_app
NODE_ENV=production
```

> **Insight:** Using environment variables is crucial for maintaining security and flexibility across different deployment environments.

6. Started the application with PM2:

    ```bash
    pm2 start index.js --name mean-app
    ```

7. Kept the app running and ensured it restarted automatically after crashes or system reboots:

    ```bash
    pm2 startup
    sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin /usr/lib/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 startup systemd -u <linux user> --hp /home/<linux user>
    pm2 save
    ```

In my case, `ubuntu` is the `linux user` for the EC2 instance.

> **Personal Note:** Make sure you are inside the backend folder before running the command above.

## Final Steps and Reflections

1. Checked the process status:

    ```bash
    pm2 logs mean-app
    ```

2. Accessed the application at `http://<aws-ec2-instance-public-ip>`.

3. Tested the backend API using Postman and Browser:

    sample datas to use:

    ```bash
    [
        {
            "name": "The Pragmatic Programmer",
            "isbn": "978-0201616224",
            "author": "Andrew Hunt, David Thomas",
            "pages": 352
        },
        {
            "name": "Clean Code",
            "isbn": "978-0132350884",
            "author": "Robert C. Martin",
            "pages": 464
        },
        {
            "name": "You Don’t Know JS: Scope & Closures",
            "isbn": "978-1449335588",
            "author": "Kyle Simpson",
            "pages": 98
        }
    ]
    ```
